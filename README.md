VBA Challenge 

My code is 2 separate files - I could not get it to work as one file with all the nested loops, etc.
Also, this worked on the test file (the 2 code files) but when I moved it from the test file to the larger stock data file, it broke. After spending the weekend getting this to work for the test file, I just didn't have the time to rework the entire code again. 
When I tried retesting the code in the test file, it broke there as well. I believe that I have all the correct components though, as I was able to get the Summary Table Header printed on all the tabs as well as all the unique tickers, total stock volume in addition to the calculations of percent change and daily change. I also had the conditional formatting of color coding the daily change working and formatting percent change as a percentage.
