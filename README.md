VBA Challenge 

My code is 2 separate files - I could not get it to work as one file with all the nested loops, etc.
Also, this worked on the test file (the 2 code files) but when I moved it from the test file to the larger stock data file, it broke. After spending the weekend getting this to work for the test file, I just didn't have the time to rework the entire code again.
